# Welcome to Vertigo Mk1 Docs

Two engineers designed the Vertigo Mk1 so they could avoid walking downstairs to start a new print. They figured it might come in handy for some other folks too.

This is a community effort to provide documentation for the Vertigo Mk1 3D printer.

If that kind of thing excites you, please [contribute to the project on Github](https://github.com/AutomatedLayers/VertigoMk1/tree/main/docs)!
