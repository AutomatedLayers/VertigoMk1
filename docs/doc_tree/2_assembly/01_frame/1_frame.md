## Steps

{: .note}
There are two versions of the printed part "Frame Post Connector": one for LDO extrusions and one for Misumi.

{: .note}
This works best on a granite surface or the flattest surface you've got. The use of a machinist's square or dial guage is highly recommended to ensure squareness.

### 1. Assemble the right and left sides of the frame first
 - Screw the **M5x16 button heads** into the tapped holes on the ends of the extrusions (that have them) leaving a 2.5mm gap
 - Slide the joining extrusions onto the button heads. Tighten through the through-hole
 - See the video to use extrusions as guides for ensuring squareness and alignment
 - Make sure the cutout in the printed Frame Post Connectors are facing out

### 2. Attach the sides together
 - Attach the bottom and top front extrusions 
 - Attach the rear extrusion using the alignment tools
 - Attach the rear top extrusion

{: .important}
You really want to make sure your frame is square at this point. Measure and make adjustments as needed. The diagnoals for the top and bottom square should measure 523.3mm (+/-1).
