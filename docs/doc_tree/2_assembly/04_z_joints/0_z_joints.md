# Z Joints

![]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/z_joints.webp)

These are the components that move with the Z axis carriage blocks. Together, they serve three primary functions:
 - Lower the print bed in the "Z" direction during printing
 - Provide a Kelvin kinematic coupling for a well constrained print surface leveling procedure
 - Create a hinge/latch mechanism that enables the bed scraping motion
