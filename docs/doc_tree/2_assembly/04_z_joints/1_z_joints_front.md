## Steps
### 1. Assemble Front Z Joint B
 - Press in 2 **M3x5.7 Brass Inserts** to the Front Joint B - Carriage Block printed part
 - Slide the **M3x10 Coupling Nut** into the rear slot in the Front Joint B - Carriage Block printed part
 - Push in 2 **M3x25 SHCS** as shown
 - Use 2 **M3x25 SHCS** to attach the Front Joint B - Rear Cover printed part
 - Press in 2 **M3x4.3 Brass Inserts** to the Front Joint B - Endstop Adjustment printed part
 - Thread a **M5x20 BHCS** into the Front Joint B - Endstop Adjustment printed part. The proper location of this screw will be adjusted later
 - **[ Side B Only** Thread a **M3x10 SHCS** into the Front Joint B - Endstop Adjustment printed part. The proper location of this screw will be adjusted later **]**
 - Slide the Front Joint B - Middle Support into place and fasten it with 2 **M3x40 SHCS**
 - Slide the **M3x10 Coupling Nut** into the front slot in the Front Joint B - Carriage Block printed part
 - Push in 2 **M3x35 SHCS** as shown
 - Use 2 **M3x16 SHCS** to attach a belt clamp to the top and bottom of the Front Joint B - Carriage Block printed part
 - Press the **Spherical Bearing - GE5C** into the Front Joint - Spherical Bearing Block printed part
 - Make sure the slot in the printed bearing block points toward the belt clamps
 - Push an **M5x40 BHCS** through the spherical bearing and Z Joint, and thread it into an **M5 Roll-In Nut** but do not tighten

### 2. Assemble Front Z Joint Bar
 - Repeat Step 1 for Front Z Joint A
 - Slide the Z Joints onto either end of the **Extrusion 2020-320** such that the roll-in nuts enter the extrusion slot
 - Leave about 1mm on each side and snug the **M5x40 BHCS** but still do not tighten yet

{: .important}
At this point it's easiest if you continue to the section: [Bed Lever](3_bed_lever.html), before returning here to attach the Front Z Joint Bar (even though the animation would have you believe otherwise).

 - Attach the Front Z Joint Bar to the Z Axis Linear Carriages by first tightening the captive fasteners, then the outer fasteners
 - Make sure the gaps are about even on both ends of the extrusion and that the Front Z Joint Bar slides freely up and down the Z Axis
 - Finally you get to tighten the **M5x40 BHCS**
