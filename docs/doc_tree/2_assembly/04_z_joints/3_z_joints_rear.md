## Steps
### 1. Assemble Front Z Joint B
 - Slide the **M3x10 Coupling Nut** into the inner slot in the Rear Joint B - Carriage Block printed part
 - Push in 2 **M3x25 SHCS** as shown
 - Drop in 2 **M3 Hex Nuts** to the slots on the top and bottom of the Rear Joint B - Cub Block printed part
 - Use 2 **M3x25 SHCS** to fasten the carriage block to the cup block
 - Tighten a **M3x40 SHCS** through the carriage block into a **M3 Hex Nut** in the cup block
 - Slide the **M3x10 Coupling Nut** into the outer slot in the Rear Joint B - Carriage Block printed part. If it falls out, just remember to put it in before attaching the joint to the linear carrige
 - Use 2 **M3x16 SHCS** to attach a belt clamp to the top and bottom of the Rear Joint B - Carriage Block printed part

### 2. Assemble Kinematic Seatbelt
 - Press in 2 **M3x4.3 Brass Insert** to the Rear Joint B - Kinematic Slot Seatbelt R printed part
 - Use 2 **M3x16 SHCS** to attach both sides of the kinematic seatbelt
 - Thread a **M5x20 BHCS** into the Rear Joint B - Dowel Cap printed part. The proper location of this screw will be adjusted later
 - Press fit 2 **M3x60 Dowels** into the dowel cap and slide the dowels into the holes in the cup block
 - Place an **M3 Hex Nut** in the pocket on cup block and hold the kinematic seatbelt over the nut in position
 - Slide the dowels all the way through the cup block and seatbelt until the dowel cap touches the cup block
 - Use an **M3x16 SHCS** to fix the dowel cap in place 

{: .important}
The dowels should fit into the dowel cap and cup block tightly and not wiggle at all. If they do, adjust the holes or scaling in your slicer and reprint parts as needed. 
For Rear Z Joint Side A: the kinematic seatbelt should slide along the dowels, but they should not be loose, like a snug slip fit.

### 3. Attach Rear Z Joint to Linear Carriage
 - Push in 2 **M3x45 SHCS** to the cup block as shown
 - Attach the Rear Z Joint to the rear linear carriage using the same procedure as the Front Z Joints; captive screws first, then outer screws
 - **[ Side B Only** Loosen the M3 SHCS holding the dowel cap in place and slide on the two printed Seatbelt Locks as shown. Re-tigten the M3 SHCS **]**
