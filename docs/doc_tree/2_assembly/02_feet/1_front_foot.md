### 1. Attach the Foot Housing to the Frame
 - Place the **M5 Hex Nuts** and **M3 Hex Nuts** in their slots
 - Place three **M5 T-Nuts** in the bottom slots of the frame
 - Use two **M5x35 BHCS** to attach the Foot Frame to the Frame. Use the **M5x60 BHCS** to align its corresponding t-nut then remove it for now
 - Use two **M5x60 BHCS** and two **M3x35 SHCS** to attach the Foot Base to the Foot Frame

### 2. Assemble the Tensioner
 - Place an **M5 Hex Nut** in the Z Tensioner knob and slide the knob under the tensioner housing
 - Place an **M5 Hex Nut** under the Tensioner and screw an **M5x30 BHCS** through the Tensioner and Nut
 - Screw an **M5x30 BHCS** through the Tensioner and **GT2 Idler Pulley - 9mmm**
 - Rotate the Tensioner Knob to screw the Tensioner down, leaving about 10mm of space below the Tensioner
 - Screw the **M5x60 BHCS** from Step 1 through the Foot Base, Tensioner Knob, and Foot Frame into the aligned t-nut
  
### 3. Attach the Swivel Foot
 - Insert the Replaceable Thread Plug (long hexagon shape) into the Foot Base and the **M8 Hex Nut** in its slot
 - The Replaceable Thread Plug Retainer has a divet that needs to align to the M3 hole on the front of the Foot Base
 - Push the Retainer against the Thread Plug and lock the stack with the **M3x45 SHCS**
 - Slide the Height Adjustment Knob onto the Swivel foot, and make sure it fits over the hex nut
 - Rotate the Height Adjustment Knob to screw the Swivel Foot into the Foot Base
