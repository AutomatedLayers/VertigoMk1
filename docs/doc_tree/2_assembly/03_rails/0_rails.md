## Steps

{: .note}
The spring in some of the roll-in nuts may not fully engage with the extrusion, allowing the nuts to slide freely in the slots. Try pushing the ball in the nut a few times to work it in, or try a different nut. There should be quite a few extras in the kit

### 1. Attach the Front Z-Rails to the Frame
 - Keep two rubber stoppers in the ends of the linear rails to keep the carriages on for now
 - Place 7 **M3 Roll-in Nuts** into the front vertical extrusions, using the **MGN9H-300 Linear Guide** to align the nuts
 - Loosly fasten the **MGN9H-300 Linear Guide** to the extrusion using 7 **M3x8 SHCS**
 - Push the rail against the bottom extrusion and remove the rubber stoppers
 - Move the carraige out of the way and press on the two printed Linear Rail Alignment tools near the ends of the rail
 - Tighten the fasteners while holding the alignment tools in place
  
{: .important}
Take care not to overtighten the linear rail screws

 - Remove alignment tools

### 2. Attach the Rear Z-Rails to the Frame
 - Repeat the process for the rear Z-rails

### 3. Attach the Y-Rails to the Frame
 - Use the Y-Rail Alignment Tool to ensure correct location
