# Feet

![]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/feet_assy.png)

The feet provide a sturdy base for the printer. Each one has a self-leveling rubber swivel pad on an M8 bolt that is adjustable up to 20mm. Taller swivel foot bolts can be used if you want to raise the printer higher. The feet also house the tensioners for the Z-axis belts. In the rear there are some swappable nuggets in case you want to put something else in there.
