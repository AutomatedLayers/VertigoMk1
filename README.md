# VertigoMk1
## Automation for Makers

Vertigo Mk1 is a 3D printer designed for automation. Some of its distinct features include:
- A bed that rotates to a vertical position and scrapes printed parts off and out the bottom
- Print queues, batch jobs, and remote failure recovery
- Scraper modules that use afforable plastic razor that are easy to replace and won't damage the print surface
- A height-adjustable scraper bar that can hold different scraper moodules - including those designed by YOU
- The ability to print and remove parts made with various materials
- Compatibility with different magnetic print surfaces, i.e. PEI, PEO, PEY, Garolite/FR4/G10, etc. 
- The easily swappable and serviceable Hitchcock toolhead
- A reciprocating filament cutter under the extruder that won't get stuck while cutting
- Compatibility with multi-material and automatic filament replacement systems
- An elecronics backpack that can be easily accessed and serviced

## The STL files and BOM are released for **beta testing**. We welcome suggestions through GitHub's isssue tracker. During this phase of the project, there may be some updates to the STLs and BOM, so check the [STL change history](https://github.com/AutomatedLayers/VertigoMk1/commits/main/hardware/STL) and the [BOM change history](https://github.com/AutomatedLayers/VertigoMk1/commits/main/hardware/BOM.csv)
