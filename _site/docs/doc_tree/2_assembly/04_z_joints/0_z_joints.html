<p>These are the components that move with the Z axis carriage blocks. Together, they serve three primary functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lower the print bed in the “Z” direction during printing</li>
  <li>Provide a Kelvin kinematic coupling for a well constrained print surface leveling procedure</li>
  <li>Create a hinge/latch mechanism that enables the bed scraping motion</li>
</ul>
