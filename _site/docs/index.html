<h1 id="welcome-to-vertigo-mk1-docs">Welcome to Vertigo Mk1 Docs</h1>

<p>Two engineers designed the Vertigo Mk1 so they could avoid walking downstairs to start a new print. They figured it might come in handy for some other folks too.</p>

<p>This is a community effort to provide documentation for the Vertigo Mk1 3D printer. If that kind of thing excites you, please <a href="https://github.com/AutomatedLayers/VertigoMk1/tree/main/docs">contribute to the project on Github</a>!</p>
