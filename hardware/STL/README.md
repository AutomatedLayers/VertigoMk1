# Notes on printing these parts

This printer is designed to use ASA printed parts and we strongly recommend using ASA or ABS to print the majority of these parts. ASA is [comparable to ABS](https://all3dp.com/2/asa-vs-abs-differences). Other materials may work however YMMV. There are a few parts that should be printed with another material, i.e. translucent light diffusers. 

ASA and ABS shrink after printing. Remeber to calibrate your slicer scaling settings for your specific filament's rate of shrinkage. I.E. We scale our parts up by ~0.8% when printing with Polylite ASA
